# RepetitionSchema

This a module that contains several different types of repetition schema, or ways to order information for learning. This module can be used to enhance how much users learn, by changing the repetition scheme based on how they perform. This module contains a small example where the user is tested on what chinese tone they hear, and the scheme is changed based on whether they were correct or incorrect. 

In the future the goal of this module is to also implement a process known as supermemo, which is a process that uses neural nets in order to pinpoint what the user finds to be most difficult, and work on improving those weakpoints in the user's understanding.
